# Contributing ideas to Bitrise

This guide is here to give you some hints about how to add a contribution request to [Bitrise](https://bitrise.io). The thing is, this repository doesn't contain any code.

## Create an issue

1. Please specify whether you'd like to propose a new [step](https://bitrise.io/integrations), a tweak to our infrastructure, or a nice new tool.

2. Link to the new thing, or explain what's the idea.

3. Don't forget to mention which platform is your thing, iOS, Android, Xamarin, all, or a new one? Or, which stack you'd like to have tweaked? [OS X](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap), [Linux (Docker)](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/bitrise-base), a new one?

3. Are you going to work on it, or it's just a suggestion for others who'd like to contribute? *By the way, you are eligible for an 50% discount for the [Pro plan with 1 container](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing), if you're a Bitrise step contributor. And a sticker. [A very nice sticker](http://blog.bitrise.io/images/contributor_mockup.jpg).*
